# Exploratory Data Analysis Project 1

## Project Summary 
* This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 
 
## Data 
* The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:
* 1.Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
* 2.Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
* 3.Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
* 4.Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
* 5.Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 
* 6.Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
* 7.Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a       dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
* 8.Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a         washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
* 9.Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

## Project steps
* Generally there are three basic steps to approach this project completion: 
* a. Study project introduction: https://github.com/TomLous/coursera-exploratory-data-analysis-course-project-1/blob/master/README.md
* b. Download and load project data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
* c. Generate required R plots: (see uploaded files)

## Uploaded files 
* In this repository, four plot files (.png) and those related R codes (5 codes) will be uploaded to the folder.
